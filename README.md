# Manage-Landing-Page
This project was built as part of a challenge from the Frontend Mentor website. It was developed using Tailwind CSS to test and improve my skills in utility-first styling and responsive design. The goal was to recreate the provided layout as accurately and cleanly as possible using Tailwind's utility classes.
